# Learn Sequelize.js

This library acts as a playground to learn to use Sequelize. There is many documentation and implementation that you can explore to learn, and also to use in your projects.

## Tools I use

To test around with Sequelize I mainly use:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)
* Node.js 12
* MySQL 8 (Community Edition) as SQL server
* JavaScript ES6 / ES2015
* Object oriented concept

## How to get started?

In the file overview there is a folder called [`_getting-started`](/_getting-started/) which is the entry point to learn Sequelize from scratch. This folder contains examples where I demonstrate how to implement functionalities of Sequelize. You can use the official Sequelize [manual](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html) in parallel to have a more explanation. The learning order is based on the official Sequelize [manual](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html).

All other folders contain snippets and mini-projects where I try out the possibilities of Sequelize. This can be used as templates or in your project for further development.
