# Learn Sequelize.js

This library acts as a playground to learn to use Sequelize. There is many documentation and implementation that you can explore to learn and also to use your projects.

## Tools I use

To test around with Sequelize I mainly use:

* Visual Studio Code
* Node.js 12
* MySQL 8 (Community Edition) as SQL server
* JavaScript ES6 /ES2015

## How to get started?

In the file overview there is a folder called `_getting-started` which is the entry point to learn Sequelize from scratch. These folder contain examples where I demonstrate how to implement functionalities of Sequelize. You can use the official Sequelize [manual](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html) in parallel to have a more explanation. The learning order is based on the official Sequelize [manual](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/getting-started.html).

All other folders contain snippets and mini-projects where I try out the possibilities of Sequelize. This can be used as templates or in your project for further development.
